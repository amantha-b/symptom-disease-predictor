Symptom-based Disease Predictor

Author: Amantha Bhaskarabhatla

This project is a machine learning–driven web application that predicts the most likely disease based on user-selected symptoms. It uses a pre-trained Random Forest classification model and a professional, customizable Streamlit interface.

This application is not intended for real medical use.
